# stattotex

Forked versions of Ian Sappolnik's great [`stattotex`](https://github.com/isapollnik/stattotex)  command with added `string` option.

A Stata command to automatically place a calculation into LaTeX -- no more hard coding!

See the PDF and do file for more details.

You can install the latest version of the *FORKED* command by executing the following code:

`net install stattotex, from("https://raw.github.com/cg89x/stattotex/master/") replace`
